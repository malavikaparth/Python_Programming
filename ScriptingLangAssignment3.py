#2)Write a function that returns the smallest and largest element in a list (without using the
#built-in Python functions and methods such as sort, min and max!). Note that the function
#returns two values!

#Nested lists

# Write a function that takes a nested list as argument, and returns the length of the longest
#list. For example: [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9],[10]] ïƒ  4 since the longest list is [6,7,8,9] and its
#length is 4

    return length



print(longList( [[1,2,3],[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,00],[5,6,7,8,9],[10]]))

#2. Write a function that has a nested list as an argument and calculates the averages of the jth
#elementsin each sub-list. Beware: the length of the list of averages should be as long as the
#longest sub-list! For example [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8,9], [10]] should return [5.25, 4.67, 5.5, 9.0]
#(calculated as follows[(1+4+6+10)/4, (2+5+7)/3, (3+8)/2 ,9/1]).

def averageLsit(myList):
    average = 0
    returnList = []
    length = longList(myList)
    for i in range(length): #VERY IMP!!!
        l = []
        for j in myList:
            if(i<len(j)): #VERY IMP!!!
               l.append(j[i])
            else:
                l.append(0)
